# What is a Healthy Child?

Let's analyze what a healthy child is, and the changes there have been through the years at different countries of the world.

## Background

Do you remember you or your sibling going to the doctor for a check-up to hear a conversation about what percentile the measured height and weight were in? The World Health Organization gets some bad press at times of pandemics, but they do much more than managing pandemics. With the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC), they define the standards <a href=" https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm">standards</a> for those percentiles that you hear.


## The Challenge

We have repeated measurements of weights and heights for children from varied multiple countries (United States, Netherlands, Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, and Tanzania). We will use these measures to explain the health of the children in each study location and to explore children that have poor health over most of their measurements (note: subjects were part of a study of specific groups and are not representative of the country).

## Results

HAZ  is the Height in SDS relative to WHO child growth standard. We can consider 0 (zero) to be a normal value. Four random males and females were selected based on the criteria to be "healthy" (near or over 0) or "unhealthy" (far from 0).

This chart will show the distribution of children's heights of different countries at day 365.

WAZ is the Weight in SDS relative to WHO child growth standard. We can consider 0 (zero) to be a normal value. This map will show the Average WAZ in these countries.
